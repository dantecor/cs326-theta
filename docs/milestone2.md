# Food Match API
The Food Match API can be categorized as a RESTful API. It allows users to find restaurants in Amherst, Massachusetts based on their dietary needs. Users can search for restaurants by location and filter in accordance to their menu items. The API can be used to find restaurants with vegeterian, vegan, and gluten-free meal options. Users can specify their dietary needs by registering their user information into the website's database. In addition to this, new restaurants can add items to the database such as their contact, address, and menu information.

# Concepts
