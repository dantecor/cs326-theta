# Innovative Idea

Our Application, Food Match will allow people with allergies or intolerances to certain foods to find restaurants that will cater to their needs. The application will allow users to find restaurants based on whether they can cater to dietary needs. Users will be able to then view the menu for restaurants that can cater to their specific needs and filter menu items based on the allergen specified. As far as our team knows, this application may have unique elements, but it would most likely be compared to an application like yelp. Users would be able to leave reviews for restaurants depending on how well they cater to certain allergies and intolerances.


# Important Components

An important component will be to display restaurant data. For that, our team will leverage an API that will provide relevant information, such as the restaurants,menu and location. Our website will allow users to log in and save restaurants that they like. They would also be able to leave reviews for restaurants they have visited. The application will have to communicate with a backend service for persistent data storage. We will need to keep login information in the database as well as data for reviews and comments.
